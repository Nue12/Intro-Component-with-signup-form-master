# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form

![Design preview for the Intro component with sign up form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

In this challenge, I use JavaScript to check the form was fill or not.

## In addition

For email, if you don't fill with email form, 
the error ("Looks like not an email") will pop up.

For password, if you don't use the charater a-z, A-Z, 0-9, 
the error and alert box will pop up.
And password need to fill at least 6 character
